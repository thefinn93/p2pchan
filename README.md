p2pchan
=======

Peer-to-peer imageboard for cjdns. In it's current state it's incredibly broken and kinda sorta works.
It is likely one of the following two things will happen:

 * I will fix the brokeness and forget to update this
 * I will get bored with this and forget about the whole project in under a week.

Possibly both. Use at your own risk.
